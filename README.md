## Profile
Hello World. My name is Miles Kim Parr. I am a first year D&D MURP student at Luskin. I have lived in and around LA since I was 6 years old and have essentially never left. I also don't have a planning background so I feel like I learn a lot of new things in every class that I take. 

I have never used Github or JupyterLab before so this is very new to me. I took one class with R but that was 5 years ago so I don't count it. I have more experience with ArcGIS and QGIS but I'm not sure that it will help me much here.

Otherwise, I am passionate about being active. I have played many sports throughout my life and I currently am focusing on Powerlifting and Basketball, two sports that inhibit my progress in the other. Maybe its a little boring but I enjoy interacting with controlled amounts of nature like urban parks, arboretums, and gardens. Camping and hiking and all that I can do every once in a while, but at heart I love being in the city.  

## Course Description
### UP 221 - Introduction to GIS and Spatial Data Science
>The goal for this course is to expose you to the foundations of spatial data science. Where once there was a dearth of available digital information, we now live in a world of too much data. How can these data be transformed into human expressions and narratives, and how can these be represented spatially? Our understanding of social phenomena through spatial constructs in urban data allows us to address location-based questions on social justice, the environment, transportation, community development and design, amongst many other themes, and how these factors may affect different population groups in different ways.
>
>This course prepares you for challenges in urban data beyond off-the-shelf cartographic approaches. It looks at the various components of data’s journey—acquisition, exploration, modeling, and communication through visualization—and how it enables and advances your research from a data science perspective.
>
>We begin with an introduction to various data science tools, and review the basics of programming with Python. Once a foundation of Python programming and data wrangling is achieved, spatial analysis through Python Libraries, and subsequently, through advanced geoprocessing will be introduced. All lessons will be based on “real” data with analytical methods addressing relevant and contemporary urban problems.
>
>In addition to the programming lab sessions, you will be given weekly or bi-weekly "thinking cap" assignments, where you will be asked to think critically about contemporary urban issues. Be prepared to address various topics from the perspective of your own lived experiences, how it informs the topic, and what kind of research can advance knowledge in a positive way.
>
>While there are no prerequisites for taking this course, people who are approaching programming for the first time will admittedly find the course to be intense and challenging.

## Project Ideas
I don't have many concrete ideas for my project right now. I am interested in adaptive resuse projects focusing on creating urban green space and expanding connectivity. 

I am looking forward to seeing what project ideas 

## Objectives for the class
I was pleasantly suprised to learn that this class is focused on Python. I registered for this class expecting to sharpen up my GIS experience and learn about ways to improve my outputs (reports, etc.) through spatial data. I am very excited to learn the basics of Python as I thought I would never really have a chance based on the MURP curriculum. I look forward to seeing how this class can make me a better urban and graphic designer.
